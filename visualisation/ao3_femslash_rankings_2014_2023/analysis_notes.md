re: Harry Potter becoming one of the most popular fandoms since 2020 smh

I would like to formally shame the AO3 femslash community for making Harry Potter this popular in the specific years since JKR's public coming out as a radical transphobe in 2020. Even among all the rough diversity stats in this data project, that alone is possibly the most direct, bad reflection on the fandom community's bias I've seen so far. It can't be blamed on mainstream media the way other statistics (ex. "Oh well, there's not enough diversity in popular media, so we can't find enough diverse characters to ship") could (there was no movie in the Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts franchise released in this timeframe, the highest ranked femslash pairing in 2022/2023 literally does not physically appear in any movie/game (likely a background pairing for what I'm guessing will be some M/M pairing we have yet to look at)), nor on ignorance (I don't think anyone in the english speaking world, let alone *in the Harry Potter fandom*, has not heard of JKR's transphobia), meaning amidst wide-spread public backlash and boycotts of anything JKR/Harry Potter, the fandom chose to write a higher-than-usual amount of Harry Potter fanfic instead.
