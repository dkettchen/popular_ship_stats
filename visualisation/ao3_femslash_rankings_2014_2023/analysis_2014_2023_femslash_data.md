# Femslash ranking data 2014-2023 

- Ranking based on the all-time total number of femslash works available on AO3 at time of OP's data collection
- OP noted that 2023 numbers are somewhat scewed due to a lot of people deleting or privating works because of an AI scraping scare, causing notably popular pairings to show lower numbers than one may expect. However this should be less of an issue for our all-time (general or femslash) rankings than for the yearly (general) one we have yet to look at.
- The first femslash ranking in 2014 only consisted of 50 ranks rather than 100, so 2014 numbers will look scewed on most diagrams (ie less items or higher ranks due to less ranked ships that year).

## General stats

### Top fandoms

These are the fandoms that accounted for the most ships in the femslash ranking each year.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_fandom_market_share_2014_2023.png)

Between 2014 and 2016 Homestuck took up the biggest market share, but since 2017 was replaced by DC, largely due to the number of Supergirl ships.

While Glee took up the second spot in 2014, it was quickly overtaken by Marvel, which stayed in second place for 2015 and 2016, was overtaken by Steven Universe between 2017 and 2019, and returned in 2020. 

Other fandoms that made 3rd place include Once Upon a time in 2014, Supernatural in 2015, The 100 from 2016-2017, and Harry Potter from 2022-2023.

These are the fandoms that were the most popular when weighted for their rank, ie the higher the rank of a ship the more points it got and then the points of all the ships in the fandom were added together.

While the overall trends are similar to the market share figure, here Marvel managed to overtake Homestuck in 2016.
Harry Potter made 2nd place in 2023, after slowly making its way up the top 15 since 2019. 
Glee stayed in the top 3 until 2016 and in the top 7 for all nine years. 
DC, The 100 and RWBY stayed in the top 15 ever since entering it in 2015. 
Once Upon a Time, in spite of only having one ship since 2019, still made the top 15 every year except 2019. 
Homestuck stayed in the top 15 until dropping out in 2023.
Marvel and Attack on Titan managed to stay in the top 15 for all nine years. 

These are the top 5 fandoms by market share and popularity each year.

DC has dominated both rankings since 2017.

### Top ships

These are the ships that have made the top 5 both the most times and the longest in a row.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_longest_running_ships_2014_2023.png)

Once Upon a Time's Emma Swan and Regina Mills stayed in the top 5 (the top 2 even) for all 9 years. Clexa stayed in the top 5 for 7 years in a row, and DC Supergirl's Kara Danvers and Lena Luther have been in there for 6.

(Yes, they are all blonde, white protagonist + dark-haired, also white(-passing) lady. We love diversity here, don't we.)

### RPF

This is the RPF to non-RPF ratio for each year.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_rpf_2014_2023.png)

The femslash ranking has a lower rate of RPF (<5%) than our [total figure](../ao3_all_data_2013_2023/ao3_all_data_charts/all_ao3_ranked_ships_rpf_vs_fic_2013_2023.png) showed (13%), likely indicating a significantly higher number of RPF ships in the general ranking/among M/M ships. 

The femslash RPF ships in question were two music related ships (Red Velvet and Fifth Harmony), two drag queen ships and four Women's Soccer ones.

### Gender

Although this is the femslash ranking, I still made a gender graph as there are female-leaning characters (mostly the crystal gems as noted in [the main data set's analysis](../ao3_all_data_2013_2023/analysis_2013_2023_overall_data.md)) and drag queens in the ranking.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_gender_stats/femslash_gender_distribution_2014_2023.png)

The drag queens made the ranking between 2019 and 2021. Female leaning characters were most prominent between 2016 and 2020, falling off in recent years.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_gender_stats/femslash_gender_minority_distr_2014_2023.png)

Both groups are still vastly outnumbered by binary female characters whose lowest percentages hovered around 93.5% between 2016 and 2021.

## Race stats

### Racial groups

These are the racial groups represented each year.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_racial_distribution_2014_2023.png)

White characters once again outnumbered every other group. However since 2019 east asians took up second place. The top 4 for all 9 years have consisted of white characters, east asians, ambiguous and non-human characters. Latin (incl. afro-latin) characters have taken up 5th place until 2021, when they were surpassed by south east asian characters.

Taking out white, east asian, non-human, ambiguous, and unknown characters, we can see that the number of most minority racial groups, with the exception of latin characters, have increased over the years, with (non-east) asian characters having the most drasting increase.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_racial_minority_distr_2014_2023.png)

The number of racial groups has steadily increased over the years too, increasing by 50% from 16 in 2015 to 24 different groups in 2023.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_racial_groups_no_2014_2023.png)

#### Multiracial characters

Multiracial characters have made up between 4% and 8.5% over the years.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_multi_char_pies_2014_2023.png)

Their number has steadily increased over the years as well, nearly doubling between 2015 and 2023.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_multi_char_line_2014_2023.png)

### Racial combinations

These are the racial combinations of ships over the years.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_race_combo_distr_2014_2023.png)

White/white ships accounted for just under half of ships. East asian/east asian ships made up second place since 2021, but have been in the top 5 since 2015. The other top ranked ship combos are made up of ambiguous characters, non-human characters and/or involve at least one white character.

#### Interracial ships

These diagrams show the number of interracial ships.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_interracial_ships_pies_2014_2023.png)

Interracial ships have gone from making up about a fourth to about a third of the total.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_interracial_ships_lines_2014_2023.png)

Their number has steadily increased, while that of non-interracial ships stayed roughly stable, and ships involving characters of ambiguous race have decreased.

#### Ships involving multiracial characters

Ships involving multiracial characters roughly reflect the number of multiracial characters present.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_multi_involved_ships_pies_2014_2023.png)

Their number increased from under 8% in 2015 to almost double that in 2022 and 2023.

Accordingly, line go up.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_multi_involved_ships_line_2014_2023.png)

#### Ships with and without white and east asian characters

This is the number of ships involving at least one white character, involving at least one east asian character, not involving any white characters, and not involving white or east asian characters.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_non_white_distr_2014_2023.png)

The ratios are similarly dreadful as in the total analysis, but east asian involved ships have pretty steadily grown in number over the years.

This figure shows the average rank that each category had each year.

![alt text](ao3_femslash_rankings_charts/femslash_race_stats/femslash_non_white_avg_ranks_2014_2023.png)

White involved, east asian involved and non-white ships hovered around the half-way point, indicating a decent spread, while non-white or ea ships varied wildly due to their incredibly low number. 

F.e. in 2020, there was only one ship represented which happened to rank 47th, singlehandedly making for the highest average of its category over the entire period.

When looking at the average of all years' averages, white- and east asian-involved ships on average rank slightly above the halfway point, with white-involved ones ranking slightly higher than east asian-involved ones.
Both other categories rank lower, with non-white and non-east asian ships ranking the lowest out of all the categories by quite a margin.

This means that not only are there less ships per category in this same order, they are also lower ranked on average.
