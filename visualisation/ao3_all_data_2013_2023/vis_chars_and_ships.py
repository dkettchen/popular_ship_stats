# gotta specify dimensions you want to make sure it prints it at the size you want

# look into kaleido smh 
    # -figure out work flow & test w this file âœ…
    # (-make util for saving the image files)
    # -TODO:then put other notebook files into python files too & set up their work flows
    # -store old notebook files in vis folder once they've been successfully 
    #  transferred to python files

# currently kaleido can't do non-latin characters yet rip
    # https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido/issues/157 
    # possible workaround is to install language packages on the ubuntu
    # in this case language code would be ja for japanese
    # but there's others you can find at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes 
# -> jupyter notebook version managed to do foreign characters tho!
    # -> how about we put the code in py files & then import into a notebook to actually export?
    # => try and see if the dimension specification works in notebook
# update: didn't solve the issue rip 
    # -jupyter renders the characters but doesn't change size w specified dimensions 
    # -image/bytes version changes size but still uses kaleido & doesn't render the characters
    # -installing japanese language pack & fonts also didn't fix it for the latter
    # -trying to export only the jupyter bit with the characters to try and manually 
    # photoshop em together also didn't work, it defaults to only exporting the top bit
    # -tried finding a way to make jupyter output bigger, but also not yet implemented 
    # for non-text outputs smh
