observations so far to mention:

pandemic coping:
-dip in diversity until 2019 & fairly consistent since then over the pandemic
-huge east asian rep jump in 2020 which then reclined a bit again in the years since (still very high in 2021, and then lower again in 2022 -> would align w the pandemic!)
-> I'm guessing the girlies were coping with their emotional support white and east asian boys those years instead of more emotionally taxing diverse or women-involved content
    -possibly also the idea of like- if you're some white girl in the west, east asian cartoon and kpop men are likely further removed from your current reality than other ones
    -and the kpops were doing pandemic content iirc, so maybe that boosted their popularity as feel good coping content too? I'd have to look some stuff up

the 2023 AI scare:
-the minority racial groups who gained the most rep seem to be MENA & rest of asia, while black increased at its normal slope & indig also only gained a little, and latin stayed stable
-white & east asian groups took the biggest hit, bc they make up the biggest ships/fandoms that were most affected by the decrease in public works

-black characters actually doing slightly better, trendwise, on annual than on overall

minecrafters:
-dip in female characters in 2021 is due to the appearance of the minecrafters I think
-annual also has higher gen ships of all time than overall
    -> minecrafters once again it seems
    -> they've not been around for long enough to climb the overall but have had explosive growth over the past few years
    -we can see in the gen by gender combo chart that there was a huge increase in mlm gen fic that has stayed stable since 2021 -> that's the minecrafters
    -> there is a drop in rpf, so likely not only the minecrafters accounting for that, or other rpf dropping significantly with the 2023 scare? (check on bts etc it might just be them dropping off)
-youtube has ruled the top fandoms charts since 2021 too -> minecrafters!


the harry potter situation:
-HP has been in the annual ranking consistently during the entire period tracked
-there was a dip in popularity by like a few ranks in 2020 when jkr came out as a transphobe and it seems to be the only traditional fandom that gained in the top fandoms ranking in 2023 (w the scewed numbers) indicating that, while there is still a dedicated part of the fandom that wasn't even deterred by their author turning out to be a militant bigot against people that are decently numerous in the fandom community including their own fandom in its day, it generally fell in standing and apparently was less affected by the deleting/privating works, indicating the writers that stopped contributing to it didn't bother deleting/privating as much as people in other traditional fandoms like marvel that dropped from the top fandoms entirely (on both numbers & popularity) for the first time since start of tracked data
    -> the reason it is as popular as it looks is bc it is a way bigger/more established fandom than the stuff it is now listed alongside (ie minecraft youtubers, stranger things, genshin -> all way younger fandoms with less of a basis to coast off of)

reylo:
-when did the last star wars movie where they were made canon come out?
    -rise of skywalker came out in 2019!!!!!
-they exploded in 2019 & stuck around as top het ship in 2020 too, and started dropping behind other het ships again since 2021
    -> the fans that had been widely apprehensive about them as a ship due to incest reveal concerns based on star wars precedent did not touch that shit until it was canon lmao

the usual highest ranked het ship is ladybug & chat noir
-> they were only dethroned by canon reylo those two years & then dropped off by 8 ranks (among the hets) in 2023 due to AI scare in favour of more recent and more stagnant ships (ie harry potter, law & order, where ppl wouldn't bother deleting shit as much)
