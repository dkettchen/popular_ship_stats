    # dunno where they got lost in the cleaning process, we'll have to fix that
        # it did update "Youtube" as their fandom, so the fandoms are fine

# check the number of rows remains unchanged
# check there's the expected number of keys (old keys + 3)
# check everything's the expected type etc

# check fandom is in our clean fandom list (make list?)

# check relationship key is not empty
# check relationship value only contains names in our full names list (make list?)

# check there is a rpf/fic key
# check its value is either "RPF" or "fictional"

# check new "old" keys have been added
# check old keys contain original values

# check remaining keys & values have not been changed
