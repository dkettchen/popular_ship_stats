# test output data rather than individual functions leading to it
# get data from files to test

#main data:
# correct output format
# maintained length of ranking data, we didn't lose any data
# all names of fandoms have been replaced with new clean ones
# all character names have been replaced with new clean ones
# RPF is tagged as such
# items in row are expected format
# replaced names are expected format (eg no brackets etc)

#additional data in helper files:
    # fandoms
# correct output format (keys etc)
# all fandoms are present (check all ranking data against op versions??)
# items in row are expected format
# row contains additional fandom info
    # characters
# correct output format (keys etc)
# all characters are present
    # check fandoms against fandoms w characters against characters files
    # ->  if we've determined the correct length of fandoms list
            # fandoms w characters should have same length
        # if we've removed all duplicate characters
        # and no fandoms are like obviously missing their characters
            # fandoms should have their correct amount of characters
            # and therefore the total number of those characters
            # should be the amount of characters in character file
# all characters are associated with the correct fandoms
# items in row are expected format
# row contains additional character info
# added info is up to date
