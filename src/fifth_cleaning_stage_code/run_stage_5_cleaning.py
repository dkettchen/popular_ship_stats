#TODO:
# data set table: ✅
# - go through (sorted?) list of filepaths ✅
# - collect:
    # - year ✅
    # - type ✅
# - set website to be "AO3" for all these ones ✅

# characters table:
# (they all have their fandom in their dicts, so don't need to be classified by those)
# - un-categorise them -> we want a list of char names (as keys w dict values)
    # - I think we have a few names that are doubled (like "Ruby"), 
    # so maybe have the keys as like "name from fandom" or something
    # -> we can then either split by " from " or simply query the 
    # full_name/fandom key inside the value
# - add rpf or fic value

# main sets:
# - sort characters in relationship alphabetically
# - get number of characters in relationship
# - de-list characters (?) -> where less than max num "none" for other characters
# - remove gender from type column - replace with gen or slash only
# - remove race column
# - make rank a simple number
    # possibly add a "tied" column???
# - make change a simple value (ie pos. num, neg. num, "new", none)
# - add data set column
