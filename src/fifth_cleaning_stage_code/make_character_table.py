from json import dump

# first func:
# read from:
base_demographics_filepath = "data/reference_and_test_files/assigning_demographic_info/assigning_race_4_assigning_race.json"
    # pass in for possible reusability? nah, cause we're adding specific keys hm

# iterate through chars
# add rpf or fic key 
    # assign based on category
# make key names after format "name from fandom" 
    # or "name (fandom)"?? 
    # "fandom's name"?? <- would be able to still group by fandom ðŸ¤”
# assign them dict value

# then sort initial dict alphabetically
    # get sorted key list
    # for key in sorted keys
    # sorted dict[key] = old dict[key]

# return the sorted one

# print dict to a json file -> this can be moved to running file later for all of these


# second char func:
# prep previous output dict for csv:
    # remove op versions key
    # make columns list
    # make values lists for each key
    # add to nested list
    # return nested list

# print to csv using util
