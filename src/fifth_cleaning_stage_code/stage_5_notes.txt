# goals for this:
    # have a list of dicts of character info per character, which contains correct gender value ✅
        # go through sets in reverse order ✅
            # most recent to oldest, femslash, then yearly, then overall ✅
            # -> make a list of file paths in order ✅
        # collect gender values per character ✅
            # capture latest same-sex value separately (so if it's f/f or m/m) ✅
            # capture latest (in general) value too (if it is diff from same sex) ✅
            # capture all unique values in a collection ✅
        # if both latest value are (same) same sex, they can be assigned that one as their current gender ✅
        # go through all where at least one latest value is not same sex ✅
            # manually assign them as appropriate ✅
        # verify any Other characters you know of ✅
            # (angels, gems, canon gender queers, shapeshifters, player characters, drags, etc)
    # remove gender column from main data set when running next stage file creation

    # have a list of dicts of character info per character, which ALSO contains correct race value
        # go through sets in order again
            # to collect:
                # most recent value (whole list or str)
                # if list: 
                    # index in pairing
                    # if pairing has more than 2 ppl:
                        # a note abt that
                # all unique values (make lists into strings again??)
            # if they're white they should be able to be assigned no problem
            # if they're poc in recent sets they will also be assigned properly 
                # see who's leftover in old values
                    # look em up
        # research & replace asian labels w more cardinal direction specificity
        # add correct labels to everyone's gender assigned dicts
            # have a cursory look at some of em to verify 
                # (ie all the things we know have poc vs only white ppl in em)
    # remove race column from main data set when running next stage file creation
