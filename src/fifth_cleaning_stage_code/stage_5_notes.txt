# goals for this:
    # have a list of dicts of character info per character, which contains correct gender value
        # go through sets in reverse order ✅
            # most recent to oldest, femslash, then yearly, then overall ✅
            # -> make a list of file paths in order ✅
        # collect gender values per character ✅
            # capture latest same-sex value separately (so if it's f/f or m/m) ✅
            # capture latest (in general) value too (if it is diff from same sex) ✅
            # capture all unique values in a collection ✅
        # if both latest value are (same) same sex, they can be assigned that one as their current gender ✅
        # go through all where at least one latest value is not same sex ✅
            # manually assign them as appropriate ✅
        # verify any Other characters you know of ✅
            # (angels, gems, canon gender queers, shapeshifters, player characters, drags, etc)
    # remove gender column from main data set when running next stage file creation


# I just realised adam lambert is in the american idol pairing, we gotta fix that fandom name then smh
