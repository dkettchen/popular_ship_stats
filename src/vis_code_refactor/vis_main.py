# what do we want to check for?
### total data

## fandoms


# top 15 fandoms weighed for rank

# fandoms x ship type
    # num of fandoms with no/over half/only this ship type
    # avg num of ship type in fandoms
    # top 3 fandoms with most ships of this ship type

# top fandoms for racial diversity

# hottest chars per fandom (in 3+ ships)

# top 6 countries' fandoms 
    # (use single item country of origins, then char country of origins to account for idols)

## various

# rpf vs fictional ships



# TODO:

    # total gender combo of ships
    # minority gender combos
    # total race combo categories (white-inv, EA-inv, non-white, non-white/-EA)
        # also total num of last category!
    # total interracial vs non-interracial vs ambig ships
    # maybe total interracial vs etc ships for only our two biggest groups? (white & EA)
        # -> to demonstrate that most EA ships are non-interracial

    # total canon vs non canon
        # & by gender combo
    # orientation label by male/female chars
    # orientation aligned vs conflicted vs ambig w canon
        # & by gender combo
    # incest can just be numbers

    # total country distribution of fandoms
        # maybe also weighed for number of ships?
        # also by chars bc rpf folks are from diff countries?
    # total language distribution of fandoms

    # other stats by top 6 countries
        # gender distr (chars)
        # ship gender combo (ships)
        # race distr (chars)
        # fandoms from that country 
            # (fandom country of origin, where single country (ie idols), 
            # char country of origin for other rpf) -> count by chars
        # interracial ships
        # multiracial chars
        # canon by country
        # orientation by country
        # canon conflict by country
        # -> make a chart for each thingy that has data for all the 6 countries as stacked bar charts?
    # east vs west's white & EA rep % (grouped bar chart)


# TODO
# - start on chart code
    # - I wanna be able to run charts for a given time range
    # - I want any multiplot charts to adapt to the range given
    # - and/or turn multiplot charts to linear ones instead of pies (ie linegraph or stacked bar) 
    # to make more efficient to display
    # - we should have functions to prep the data by case (to reuse for both yearly ranking & total data)
    # - and then a func to compile all years into one df to use
    # - and then funcs for the actual charts

    # - I wanna add charts abt years appeared stuff
        # - number of ships vs years appeared of a fandom -> make a scatter plot 
            # & see if there's two groups: where longest running fandoms either have only 
            # very few ships that have carried their ass, or where they have the most ships -> big fandoms
        # - possibly check ships too in a similar manner? 
            # ie which ships out of big fandoms have carried them for so long
            # vs which were just kinda added by sheer size
        # - were those ships mlm/wlw/het -> cause I think femslash has more different fandoms that have lasted,
            # while mlm has a few fandoms that have not budged with the rest being more fluctuating
        # - also how many fandoms per how many years they lasted
            # also possible how many per "lasted all years since appearance"? 
            # or like how long they last on average? (ie ship joined x year, how long on average did it last after?)
            # - how long do ships usually last per type/ranking/ -> how much fluctuation is there
                # bc say the overall/femslash rankings seem decently stable
                # and femslash in general has certain ships that just stay in there for ages, 
                # even if they're not high up


#TODO (I returned after a while so I'm reorienting myself aah)
# data
# - we made it so all rankings are only up to rank 100 ‚úÖ
# - we already removed the resulting superfluous reference data ‚úÖ

# - I want to be able to access data
    # - total all years -> can use ref data bc it's up to date! ‚úÖ
    # - total all years, by ranking -> prepped in joined data as "overall"/"annual"/"femslash" ‚úÖ
    # - by each year (all rankings) -> prepped in joined data as year/"total" ‚úÖ
    # - by each year AND ranking -> various versions are prepped in joined data as year/ranking/ ‚úÖ

# - move old code to its own folder(s)??
