    # - adding types of media for fictional category
        # -many fandoms will have multiple adaptations
        # -categories I def saw so far:
            # movies (live action)
            # TV (live action)
            # web series
            # comics
            # books
            # musicals
            # animation
        # (if I find more translated versions from international properties in 
        # this research process I shall add them to their names as a case in previous function)
    # -> also add country of origin while we're at it
        # eg anime wouldn't be labelled anime, simply as "animation" from "japan"
        # -countries are easy enough to look up while looking up the property itself
        # -some fandoms may have international adaptations, hence have several countries listed
            # ex one piece from japan, but has a western adaptation now too
            # -how do we handle shows that are produced cross-countries tho? 
            # like where it was shot & made across more than one country per thing
            # & actors f.e. are from all over the place too (like the one piece example,
            # does it have an official country of origin? do we count it as US american? 
            # there were so many british ppl tho, 
            # and I know how much the americans produce over here)
                # maybe count it as the country that the production company is sitting in
                # even if it was shot/made elsewhere
                # as that's who came up with the idea & spent the money & now owns the thing
                # ex new batman movie was shot in the UK but would count 
                # as american cause the americans produced it right?
        # -for RPF list country of origin/residence of people in question
        # or where present country(ies) of origin of the media they are famous for
            # eg kpop groups should be listed as korean (even if some of the members aren't)
            # eg US american movies/TV should be listed as US american
            # but eg youtubers or sports are global categories, 
                # so should be listed for specific ppl involved instead
    # and release years while we're at it where possible
        # where it's many things we should add them individually maybe (like marvel & DC)
        # for series/franchises that spanned multiple years include beginning & end years
