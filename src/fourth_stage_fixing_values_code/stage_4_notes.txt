#TODO:
    # check that bracket caused doubles have been removed ✅
    # separate & collect name parts ✅
        # split at " | " for aliases ✅
        # split at white spaces afterwards ✅
    # categorise name parts
        # if split item starts & ends on ' -> it's a nickname
        # figure out which bits are first names, last names & aliases
    # complete name parts where missing
        # complete first/last names where missing from one double but present in the other
        # add aliases where obviously missing
        # add translations if you can find a reliable way to scrape the info 
        #   cause fucking hell it'd be a lot of work otherwise ToT


# pandas will be hecking useful for some of this current shuffling things about!
    # I am tempted to like- refactor a bunch of my functions to use pandas instead ToT
# update: we can use pandas to add the clean info to our main data sets, 
# but I still think it'll be easier to do the cleaning manually in regular python
# where I feel like I can have more control (with my current skills) and flexibility

#TODO:
# remove doubles
    #doubles are generally caused by:
        # missing parts of names vs present ones
        # brackets specifying property we don't need to specify
    # -> remove brackets ✅
    # for missing name parts more formatting is needed (see above)

# add original fandom instances to character profiles
    # eg their fandom may have many instances but they were only listed for these ones specifically
    # -> to keep track of that as we clean, same as w fandoms
# make a file that contains 
    # new name of character
    # all old names of character
    # fandom they're from (new name)
    # og instances of fandom they were listed with
    # -> to look up & replace main files from later

# -> other details will be in their separate files to be in their own tables later!
    # we should make a file that doesn't have two keys but instead is json lines or csv format
    #   with all RPF & fictional fandoms mixed in
    #   w the respective fandom's details in one line
    # and then another one to do the same w characters & their details

# add gender where same-sex slash pairings
    # start from latest info
    # do not replace after it's been added
    # if it's not a same-sex slash pairing, hence has another label, 
    #   find a way to skip or keep track of other label
# same for race where in order or same
    # from most recent info, do not replace w older info
    # otherwise keep track of untouched labels for later research & categorisation


# - adding types of media for fictional category
        # -many fandoms will have multiple adaptations
        # -categories I def saw so far:
            # movies (live action)
            # TV (live action)
            # web series
            # comics
            # books
            # musicals
            # animation
        # (if I find more translated versions from international properties in 
        # this research process I shall add them to their names as a case in previous function)
    # -> also add country of origin while we're at it
        # eg anime wouldn't be labelled anime, simply as "animation" from "japan"
        # -countries are easy enough to look up while looking up the property itself
        # -some fandoms may have international adaptations, hence have several countries listed
            # ex one piece from japan, but has a western adaptation now too
            # -how do we handle shows that are produced cross-countries tho? 
            # like where it was shot & made across more than one country per thing
            # & actors f.e. are from all over the place too (like the one piece example,
            # does it have an official country of origin? do we count it as US american? 
            # there were so many british ppl tho, 
            # and I know how much the americans produce over here)
                # maybe count it as the country that the production company is sitting in
                # even if it was shot/made elsewhere
                # as that's who came up with the idea & spent the money & now owns the thing
                # ex new batman movie was shot in the UK but would count 
                # as american cause the americans produced it right?
        # -for RPF list country of origin/residence of people in question
        # or where present country(ies) of origin of the media they are famous for
            # eg kpop groups should be listed as korean (even if some of the members aren't)
            # eg US american movies/TV should be listed as US american
            # but eg youtubers or sports are global categories, 
                # so should be listed for specific ppl involved instead
    # and release years while we're at it where possible
        # where it's many things we should add them individually maybe (like marvel & DC)
        # for series/franchises that spanned multiple years include beginning & end years

# - for pairings: add a columns abt whether they're canon or not bc that's a stat I'd like to track
    # however I'm aware of how hard this may end up being to determine for all the pairings, 
    # so uh at least the ones I know about
    # also for pairings where they are canon in one version and not canon in another 
    # (eg destiel only being canon in spanish lmao, or lan zhan/wwx only being canon in the book)
    # -> have it be more options than just is_canon: true/false, to account for those ones
