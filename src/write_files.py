#I'm not testing for file writing ones 
# if I've visually checked it with a test_run and it's formatting it correctly



#finally:
    #run all the functions in order, clean, format & extract data into new files for each filepath
        # format evolved over years, so we need to run correct functions for correct filepaths
            # 2013, 2014, 2020-2023 have regex-able spacer characters
            # 2015-2019 sets will need a different split function
        #create list of all file paths
        #cycle through file path strings, to insert into relevant split function
        #put split function output into separate function
        #put separate func output into format/file writer function
