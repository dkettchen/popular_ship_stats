This document outlines the various methodologies I used to categorise and rename data from the original data sets.

(I shall refer to the original poster of the ao3 ship ranking data as OP in this document and any relevant notes)


Fandoms:

- If multiple fandoms are part of one franchise (adaptations, multiple installations, spinoffs, etc) or otherwise set in the same universe/multiverse they get grouped under one fandom label. 

    Ex. DC characters appear across many different media types and storylines/series within them, so a fic tagged say "Batman/Joker" cannot be inferred to be about any specific instance, it can only be inferred that they are DC characters.

    Ex. House of the Dragon is a Game of Thrones spin-off, so they both are set in the Game of Thrones Universe.

    Ex. The One Piece manga, anime, and netflix live action series are all adaptations of the same story, so the fandom is One Piece, not any specific adaptation/release year.

- For non-english media, where possible and where OP hadn't already, I added the original title/spelling to the english translation, separated by a "|" (following OP's format). If OP's version was misspellt or formatted differently I corrected this.

    Ex. Free! doesn't have a japanese title, so it remains as is.

    Ex. My Hero Academia's japanese title was listed in roman characters by OP, so it gets changed to the actual kanji/kana version.

    Ex. Omniscient Reader didn't have its korean title in OP's version, so it was added.

    Ex. Heaven Official's Blessing did have its chinese title in the proper characters, but only had the roman letter version of said chinese title as a "translation" in OP's version. This was replaced with the actual english title.

- If a media piece has two (or more) relevant titles (like f.e. a book's original title vs its TV adaptation's different title) both titles are included in the new fandom name, separated by a forward slash.

    Ex. Game of Thrones is an adaptation of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series, so it becomes "A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones"

    Ex. For media with multiple translated titles, this formatting still applies, merely grouping by language like so: "魔道祖师 / 陈情令 | Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation / The Untamed"

- Any inconsistent formatting, like added specified media types, release years, sub titles, or author names, was removed from the fandom names.

    Ex. Author names were separated into their own attribute where present.

    Ex. Anything in brackets (eg "Supernatural (TV 2005)") was removed.

    Ex. Sub titles/roman numerals/numbers/etc denoting different instances of one franchise (eg "Final Fantasy X", "Persona 5" "Avatar: The Legend of Korra") were removed to group them together as a franchise instead.

- All Real Person Fic (RPF) was identified and tagged as such, as some of it was not explicitly labelled in the original data sets.

    Ex. Most bands/musicians were not labelled as RPF, despite obviously referring to real people.

    Ex. Youtuber/Online Creator RPF was not consistently labelled.

- RPF was grouped by fandom and category similarly to fictional fandoms. 

    Ex. Various different bands/musicians have their own fandom, but are all Music RPF.

    Ex. OP's various Women's soccer RPF spellings were grouped together under one label.

    Ex. Actor RPF has been grouped by associated fandom, same as fictional part of that fandom.
